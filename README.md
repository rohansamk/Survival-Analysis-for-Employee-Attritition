# Survival-Analysis-for-Employee-Attritition
Analysis of employee attrition using survival models and Kaplan-Meier curves, focusing on segmentation and key factors like compensation, job satisfaction, overtime, and travel.


This project analyzes employee attrition using survival analysis techniques. It explores factors such as job satisfaction, overtime, travel frequency, and segmentation to understand their impact on attrition risk. Kaplan-Meier survival curves, Cox Proportional Hazards models, and clustering techniques are used to identify trends and patterns in employee retention.

## Objectives
- Investigate the survival probability of employees based on tenure.
- Examine the impact of factors like overtime, job satisfaction, and department on attrition risk.
- Segment employees based on key characteristics to explore group-level differences in survival.

## Features
- Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves
- Baseline and Enhanced Cox Proportional Hazards Models
- Employee Segmentation Analysis using K-means Clustering
- Visualizations of survival probabilities and segmentation profiles

## Tools and Technologies
- **SAS**: Data processing, survival analysis, and segmentation
- **SAS Viya**: Advanced clustering and visualization

## Dataset
- **IBM HR Analytics Dataset**: Publicly available dataset used to explore employee attrition factors. 

## Key Results
- Identified high-risk factors for attrition, including frequent travel and overtime.
- Cluster-based survival analysis highlighted differences in attrition risk across employee segments.
